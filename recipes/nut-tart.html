                    <h4 class="batty4">Directions</h4>
                    <ol>
                       <li><strong>Make bones:</strong>Melt candy melts according to package directions. Transfer to a zip-top bag and snip a small hole in one corner. Pipe into a bone skeleton mold; chill 20 to 30 minutes. Tap out bones. </li>
                       <li><strong>Make pastry:</strong>Pulse together flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt in a food processor, 3 to 4 times. Add butter and pulse until butter is the size of peas, 5 to 6 times. Add cream cheese and pulse until dough forms, 10 to 12 times (add 1 to 2 tablespoons water if needed to help dough form). Wrap two-thirds of the dough in plastic wrap; flatten. Repeat with remaining one-third of the dough. Chill at least one hour and up to 2 days. </li>
                       <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Roll large piece of dough to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured work surface. Fit dough in the bottom and up the sides of an 8- by 11-inch tart pan with removable bottom; trim excess. Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Line with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang all around; fill with dried beans or rice. Bake until set around the edges, 18 to 20 minutes. Lift parchment to remove beans or rice. Bake until bottom is dry, 6 to 8 minutes more; cool. </li>
                       <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Roll small piece of dough to 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured work surface. Cut into strips of various widths. Run a fork over strips to create a wood grain pattern; transfer to prepared baking sheet. Bake until cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on baking sheet on a wire rack. </li>
                       <li><strong>Make filling:</strong> Bring sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring, until sugar has dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. When water comes to a boil, stop stirring and wash down sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to remove any undissolved sugar and prevent crystals from forming. Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until mixture is a medium amber color, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
                       <li>Remove from heat. Slowly and carefully add cream, vanilla, and salt; stir until smooth. Add nuts and pretzels; stir until caramel begins to cool and thicken slightly, about 1 minute. Pour into baked crust and spread with an offset spatula. Refrigerate until cold, 1 hour or up to 5 hours. </li>
                       <li>Remove tart ring and base and place tart on a serving platter. Decorate with chocolate skeletons and bones and pastry “boards,” crossing pastry strips to look like boards over a window. Add metallic dragées to ends of boards to look like nails, adhering with melted chocolate. Serve slightly chilled.</li>
